### Notes
I encountered too many errors. First of all, I had an issue with the fact that I started with Objective-C and had to restart. It went smoothly till I had more issues with adding in the Alamo extention and no one could help me because it seemed hopeless even though I have an updated mac. I think the biggest issue was when I couldn't reopen the project again so I will restart it. I wish that you would think I tried my best for over 8 hours trying to troubleshoot and it was very frustrating for it to be a simple and straightforward project. I think the main issue that stopped me was the Alamo extention and how it wouldn't cooperate with me.
